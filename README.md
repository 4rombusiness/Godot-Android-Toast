GodotToast 
==========
This is an Android share plugin for [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) 3.2.2 or higher. With that you'll be able to share text and/or images in your apps.

\* For Godot < 3.2 or iOS support you can use the [old module](https://github.com/Shin-NiL/Godot-Share).

**ATTENTION**: An important note is that the image you want to share must be saved on the ```"user://"``` virtual directory root to be accessible, you can use ```OS.get_user_data_dir()``` to get its absolute path (required by ```sharePic```). In the demo directory you'll find a working sample project where a screen capture is shared.
